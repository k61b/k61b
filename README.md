### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub Profile 👋

I'm a platform-focused web developer with deep experience in monorepo architecture, frontend infrastructure, and observability. I thrive at the intersection of performance, scalability, and developer experience — with a particular interest in Rust, Local LLMs, and large-scale frontend platforms.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [@Trendyol](https://github.com/Trendyol)
- 🧠 Passionate about monorepos, CI/CD pipelines, and frontend reliability engineering
- ⚙️ Recently contributed to a real-time monitoring platform using OpenTelemetry, Elasticsearch, and Grafana
- 🌱 Currently exploring Rust and building local LLM-powered tools, especially around terminal-based developer experiences
- 💬 Ask me anything about platform engineering, observability, or high-performance frontend development
